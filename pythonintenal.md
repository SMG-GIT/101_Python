### A High-Level Overview of How Python Code Gets Executed

When Python runs your code, it goes through several distinct stages:

1. **Source Code (.py):** The code you write in plain text
2. **Lexical Analysis (Tokenization):** Breaks your code into individual components
3. **Parsing (AST-Abstract Syntax Tree Generation):** Organizes these components into a structured tree
4. **Compilation to Bytecode (.pyc):** Converts the tree into machine-independent instructions
5. **Python Virtual Machine (PVM) Execution:** Runs these instructions on your computer
